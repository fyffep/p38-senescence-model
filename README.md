Senescence, the irreversible state in which a cell ceases to grow and divide, is often the consequence of 
excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation. ROS tends to cause DNA damage, but elevated levels of DNA 
damage response (DDR) foci, in turn, result in increased ROS production. This app is designed to help one 
understand this feedback loop and the proteins involved (specifically p21, p38, and p53) and how they decide a 
cell's fate between senescence, DNA damage, or apoptosis.
